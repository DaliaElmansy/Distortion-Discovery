# Distortion Discovery #Tumor Heterogeneity #Interpretable/Explainable Machine Learning

This project implements an #Explainable #Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithm that uses information theory 
to define distortion in cancer datasets ( #Tumor Heterogeneity), Spot it, and mitigate its negative impact on the accuracy 
of Tumor risk assessment
